 500 payment even if choosed any slots etc but for any booking should can pay 500 advance 
 amount not total amount liek if customer choosed 3 slots then total bill for day time will be
  6000 so the customer can pay 500 advance and rest remaining amount at the end of there time 
  and then admin can add the remaining payment image and can verify the payment and once that 
  customer get verified then the system should automatically change status of that customer to
   fully paid and can change that customer row to green soemthign liek as that is fully paid
